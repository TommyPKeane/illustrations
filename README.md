# Illustrations

Vector and Raster graphics illustrations and designs by Tommy P. Keane, using applications like Inkscape, Krita, Adobe Photoshop CC, Adobe Illustrator CC, and MS Paint.

These were created for personal, academic, or professional-related projects.

All illustrations were created by Tommy P. Keane, unless otherwise noted.

Note that most font-files (typefaces) and photographs are likely from third-parties.

## SVG Files

The SVG images are Inkscape files, so they may not render properly in a generic viewer (like a web-browser). Using Inkscape, you can export / save-as plain versions of the SVG files which would then render properly in most browsers. Inkscape can also export PNG images based on the SVG file.
